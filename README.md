# Vuespace Observatory

## About the project

  Nowadays is easy to find all the data you need but sometimes is hard to understand or requires a lot of effort to get the meaning of the data you found.

  In the field of astronomy,the amount of data available is incredible but only a few people can understand it without effort, this is one of the causes many people lost interest in this kind of themes.

  In this project I'm trying to offer a simpler view of these data that comes from the public API of the space agencies like NASA or ESA and allow to consult that info in a easier and visual way.
